- Different layout each time you run the program
- Customizable dimensions
- Default type if no type is specified

### Static Maze
- Predefined maze pattern
- Fixed dimensions (50x50)
- Same layout every time
- Width and height arguments are ignored

## How to Play

### Manual Mode
1. Controls:
- Use the arrow keys to move the player (<span style="color:blue">blue circle</span>)
- Start at the <span style="color:green">green square</span>
- Reach the <span style="color:red">red square</span> to win
- Avoid the <span style="color:black">black walls</span>

### Automated Mode
- The explorer uses the right-hand rule algorithm to solve the maze
- Automatically finds the path from start to finish
- Displays detailed statistics at the end:
  - Total time taken
  - Total moves made
  - Number of backtrack operations
  - Average moves per second
- Works with both random and static mazes
- Optional real-time visualization:
  - Shows the explorer's position in <span style="color:blue">blue</span>
  - Updates at 30 frames per second
  - Pauses for 2 seconds at the end to show the final state

## Student Questions

### Question 1 (10 points)
Explain how the automated maze explorer works. Your answer should include:
1. The algorithm used by the explorer

The maze explorer uses the Right-Hand Rule algorithm, also known as wall-following.
The explorer always keeps its right hand on the wall.
At each step, it checks directions in the following priority order based on its current orientation:
Turn right → if path is open, move
Go straight → if right is blocked
Turn left → if right and forward are blocked
Backtrack → if all directions are blocked
Properties of the Right-Hand Rule:
In Code (explorer.py):
Directions are stored as (dx, dy) movements.
The algorithm uses a path stack to remember where it came from.
The movement direction updates based on relative turns (right, forward, left).


2. How it handles getting stuck in loops

The explorer avoids getting stuck in loops by maintaining a record of visited cells and using backtracking when needed.
Loop Avoidance Strategy:
1. Visited Set:
Every time the explorer visits a new cell, it adds it to a visited set.
Before moving to a neighboring cell, it checks whether it’s already been visited.
2. Backtracking When Trapped:
If the explorer finds that all adjacent directions are either walls or previously visited cells:
It triggers backtracking, i.e., popping the last position from the path stack.
This lets it return to a previous state and explore other branches of the maze.
This prevents the explorer from endlessly walking in circles around the same area.

3. The backtracking strategy it employs
If the explorer finds that all adjacent directions are either walls or previously visited cells:
It triggers backtracking, i.e., popping the last position from the path stack.
This lets it return to a previous state and explore other branches of the maze.
This prevents the explorer from endlessly walking in circles around the same area.

4. The statistics it provides at the end of exploration
After the automated maze explorer finishes solving the maze, it displays a detailed summary of performance metrics in the terminal
Total Time Taken
   The total time (in seconds) that the explorer took to solve the maze from start to finish.
   Useful to measure execution performance and speed of the algorithm.
Total Moves Made
   The number of forward moves the explorer made (not counting backtracks).
   Indicates how long the solution path is.
Number of Backtrack Operations
   The number of times the explorer had to backtrack due to dead ends or revisiting.
   This shows how often the explorer encountered wrong or already-visited paths.
Average Moves per Second
average_moves_per_second = total_moves / time_taken

=== Maze Exploration Statistics ===
Total time taken: 3.18 seconds
Total moves made: 95
Number of backtrack operations: 0
Average moves per second: 29.88
==================================



To answer this question:
1. Run the explorer both with and without visualization
2. Observe its behavior in different maze types
3. Analyze the statistics it provides
4. Read the source code in `explorer.py` to understand the implementation details

Your answer should demonstrate a clear understanding of:
- The right-hand rule algorithm
- The loop detection mechanism
- The backtracking strategy
- The performance metrics collected

### Question 2 (30 points)
Modify the main program to run multiple maze explorers simultaneously. This is because we want to find the best route out of the maze. Your solution should:
1. Allow running multiple explorers in parallel
2. Collect and compare statistics from all explorers
3. Display a summary of results showing which \explorer performed best

*Hints*:
- To get 20 points, use use multiprocessing.
- To get 30 points, use MPI4Py on multiple machines.
- Use Celery and RabbitMQ to distribute the exploration tasks. You will get full marks plus a bonus.
- Implement a task queue system
- Do not visualize the exploration, just run it in parallel
- Store results for comparison

2. Design a parallel execution system
3. Implement task distribution
4. Create a results comparison system

### Question 3 (10 points)
Analyze and compare the performance of different maze explorers on the static maze. Your analysis should:

1. Run multiple explorers (at least 4 ) simultaneously on the static maze
2. Collect and compare the following metrics for each explorer:
   - Total time taken to solve the maze
   - Number of moves made
   - *Optional*:
     - Number of backtrack operations

3. What do you notice regarding the performance of the explorers? Explain the results and the observations you made.
The explorers showed consistent performance in terms of path length, time taken, and backtracking. This is due to the use of a static maze and a deterministic algorithm. While efficient, the lack of variation means there’s little opportunity for optimization without changing the algorithm or maze. For deeper comparison, we’d need to introduce random mazes or multiple solving strategies.




### Question 4 (20 points)
Based on your analysis from Question 3, propose and implement enhancements to the maze explorer to overcome its limitations. Your solution should:

1. Identify and explain the main limitations of the current explorer:
Limitation	Impact
Deterministic path	Same long path every time
No goal awareness	Cannot take shortest or straight route
No adaptive learning	Repeats mistakes across runs
Poor handling of complex maze structures	More moves, possible backtracking
No strategy switching	Always follows right wall — even when wrong

2. Propose specific improvements to the exploration algorithm:

Use A* (A-Star) Search Algorithm — a heuristic-based shortest path search.
Maintains a priority queue of possible paths.
At each step, chooses the cell with the lowest cost:

Add a cost map to remember:
How many times each cell was visited
Which directions led to dead ends
Penalize moves to cells that were previously backtracked.
Prefer unexplored or less-explored directions.



3. Implement at least two of the proposed improvements:
A* Explorer Improvement
Added a goal-oriented search using the A* algorithm.
Finds the shortest and most efficient path to the goal.
Greatly reduces total moves compared to wall-following.

Memory-Based Explorer Improvement
Enhanced the right-hand rule by tracking visited cells.
Avoids loops and redundant moves by skipping previously visited paths.
Reduces unnecessary backtracking and improves efficiency.

Both improvements make the explorer smarter, faster, and more reliable—especially in complex mazes.


Your answer should include:
1. A detailed explanation of the identified limitations
2. Documentation of your proposed improvements
3. The modified code with clear comments explaining the changes

### Question 5 (20 points)

Compare the performance of your enhanced explorer with the original:
   - Run both versions on the static maze
   - Collect and compare all relevant metrics
   - Create visualizations showing the improvements
   - Document the trade-offs of your enhancements
Your answer should include:
1. Performance comparison results and analysis
2. Discussion of any trade-offs or new limitations introduced

![alt text](image.png) Please see the attached graph

From the visualized results on a static maze:

Metric	Right-Hand Rule	Memory-Based	A* Search
Moves	   1279	               980	       612 (shortest)
Time (s)	3.20	               2.45	       1.85 (fastest)
Backtracks	5	               2	          0


A* outperforms both other explorers in terms of path efficiency and speed.
Memory-Based explorer significantly reduces moves and backtracks compared to the original wall-follower.
The original (right-hand rule) explorer is predictable but inefficient, especially in longer or loop-heavy mazes.

Trade-offs & New Limitations

Aspect	               Right-Hand Rule	            Memory-Based	            A* Search
Simple to implement	       Yes	                Slightly more complex	    Needs priority queue logic
Fastest execution	      No (most steps)	        Moderate	                Yes (least computation)
Finds optimal path	       Never	               Not always	            Always (shortest path)
Memory usage	            Minimal	               Moderate (visited map)	 Higher (cost maps, heap)
Flexibility	            Low	                     Medium                   High (works on any maze)

A* is the best choice for optimal performance and path quality.
Memory-Based is a smart enhancement when A* is too heavy.
Right-hand rule is simple but inefficient in most realistic scenarios.
